## Anti-fat bias in media <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

"body size is a highly visible signifier" <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Notes:
- this makes fat people both visible and invisible at the same time
- e.g. Kiki (Julia Roberts in a fat suit) in _America's Sweethearts_
- fatness as non-feminine
- women are taught to not take up space
- fat women _literally_ take up physical space


---

- media is a reflection of culture and society
- body types depicted in popular media reflect current cultural standards
- this then also reinforces and perpetuates that standard

Notes:
- current societal standards don't always reflect current societal realities
- e.g. Fikkan & Rothblum: 14% of women on prime time TV are "overweight" or "obese", but this is half the percentage of the actual population in the U.S.
- people are more likely to remember new information if it adheres to their existing beliefs and stereotypes
- positive representations of fat women in media are accused of "promoting" or "glorifying obesity"

---

fat female characters are:
- less likely to be considered attractive
- less likely to receive physical affection
- less likely to be romantic interests
- more likely to receive mean comments from men
- more likely to be targets of humor

Notes:
- images in the media have a positive correlation with a fear of becoming fat
- the greater a person's fear of fat, the more weight bias they hold
- fat rights and the experiences of fat women need as much feminist and scholarly attention as the fear of fat and fat-related self-esteem issues

cultural weight loss narrative as Bormann's "rhetorical vision"

- audience hears the story
- story "provoke[s]" powerful empathy
- audience re-enacts the story
- story is shared and reshared

Notes:
- especially true with reality tv shows

## Emily Stanton

> ...your power, which is probably the cooler power, even before I said it wasnâ€™t, but it kind of is

<small class="citation">&#8212; Lydia, to Emily, <cite>Thunder Force</cite> (1:21:42)</small>

Notes:

- movie cold opens with back-story voiceover from an invisible Emily

### "a tale of erasure"

<div class="columns equal">
  <div markdown="1">

**"before"**

invites the audience to agree with and encourage the character's weight loss
  </div>
  <div markdown="1">

**"after"**

rewards the character with success as they are now in control and worthy of acceptance in society
  </div>
</div>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/screen-training.png" -->

Notes:
- superhero power as fat femininity
- superheroes often strong, muscular men
- changing bodies: what they do, not their look or size
- exercise focus on personal superhero goals, not societal expectations
- fatness is never mentioned as part of her character

<!-- .slide: class="bg-bingo" data-background-image="images/netflixfilm-bingo.png" -->

<div markdown="1">

Fat women are relegated to background characters, but Emily is front and center as part of a team, and uses her _invisibility_ to go unnoticed and save the day

</div>

Notes:
- Emily's _visibility_:
  - everyone knows her identity, not a secret: "you're a meme now"
  - successful business owner: own the build "the sign with my name on it"
  - intelligent, inventor and scientist
  - caring and supportive mother
  - reconciled with friend, no longer "invisible" to her

## Conclusion <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---

> The media contribute to the marginalization of fat women ... by rendering them invisible when presenting a "norm" of predominantly underweight women...

Notes:
- Fikkan and Rothblum quote
- Frederick et al. contend that we need to do more to reduce anti-fat bias than simply present information that fat does not equal unhealthy
- increasing visibility of positive representation of fat women can increase positive attitudes toward fat women, decrease anti-fat bias, reduce fear of fat
