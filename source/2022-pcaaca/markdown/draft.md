## Anti-fat bias in media <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Notes:
- media is a reflection of culture and society
- society’s perception is fatness as non-feminine
- gender norms: women are taught to not take up space
- reality: fat women _literally_ take up physical space

## Anti-fat bias in media <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<div class="columns compare">
  <div markdown="1">

the dominant body types depicted in popular media reflect current cultural standards
  </div>
  <div>
    <span class="fa-solid fa-arrows-left-right fa-2xl"></span>
  </div>
  <div markdown="1">

cultural standards are upheld and reinforced by the dominant body types in popular media
  </div>
</div>

Notes:
- this makes body size, especially fat bodies, a highly visible signifier
- resulting in fat people both visible and invisible at the same time
- current societal standards don’t always reflect current societal realities
- Fikkan & Rothblum in 2012: estimate 14% of women on prime time TV are "overweight" or "obese", but this is about half the percentage of the actual population in the U.S.
- when there is positive representation of fat women in media, creators are accused of "promoting" or "glorifying obesity"

## fat female characters are

- less likely to be considered attractive
- less likely to receive physical affection
- less likely to be romantic interests
- more likely to receive mean comments from men
- more likely to be targets of humor

Notes:
- images in the media have a positive correlation with a fear of becoming fat
- the greater a person’s fear of fat, the more weight bias they hold
- people are more likely to remember new information if it already adheres to their existing beliefs and stereotypes
- therefore: fat rights and the experiences of fat women need as much feminist and scholarly attention as the fear of fat and fat-related self-esteem issues

## cultural weight loss narrative as Bormann’s “rhetorical vision”

<div class="columns equal">
  <div markdown="1">

- audience hears the story
- story arouses powerful empathy
- audience re-enacts the story
- story is shared and reshared
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <span class="fa-solid fa-arrows-rotate fa-5x"></span>
  </div>
</div>

Notes:
- especially true with reality tv shows

## Emily Stanton

> ...your power, which is probably the cooler power, even before I said it wasn’t, but it kind of is

<small class="citation">&#8212; Lydia, to Emily, <cite>Thunder Force</cite> (1:21:42)</small>

Notes:
- Emily Stanton: superpower of invisibility
- movie cold opens with back-story voiceover from an invisible Emily

### “a tale of erasure”

<div class="columns equal">
  <div markdown="1">

**“before”**

invites the audience to agree with and encourage the character’s weight loss
  </div>
  <div markdown="1">

**“after”**

rewards the character with success as they are now in control and worthy of acceptance in society
  </div>
</div>

Notes:
most narratives that involve changes in or to a fat woman’s body are based around weight loss, with the promise that this will bring her all the privileges allowed to people of a certain body size

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="video/training.gif" -->

Notes:
- changing bodies: what they do, not their look or size
- exercise focus on personal superhero goals, not societal expectations
- fatness is never mentioned as part of her character
- superhero power as fat femininity
- superheroes often strong, muscular men

---

<!-- .slide: class="bg-bingo" data-background-image="images/netflixfilm-bingo.png" -->

<div markdown="1">

Fat women are relegated to background or supporting characters, but Emily is an important half of a superhero team, and uses her _invisibility_ to go unnoticed and save the day

</div>

Notes:
- she is underestimated but...
- her invisibility allows her to take the enemy by surprise
- she uses her invisibility to her advantage in battle, sneak attacks

“you’re a meme now” <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

</div>

Notes:
- Emily’s _visibility_:
  - everyone knows her superhero identity, not a secret: grandma says
  - successful business owner: own the building that has "the sign with my name on it"
  - intelligent, inventor and scientist (finished the work her parents started to make people superheroes)
  - caring and supportive mother to a smart young woman
  - reconciled with her childhood friend, she is no longer "invisible" to her

## Conclusion <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

> The media contribute to the marginalization of fat women ... by rendering them invisible when presenting a "norm" of predominantly underweight women...

<small class="citation">Fikkan and Rothblum</small>

Notes:
- Frederick et al. contend that we need to do more to reduce anti-fat bias than simply present information that fat does not equal unhealthy
- increasing visibility of positive representation of fat women can increase positive attitudes toward fat women, decrease anti-fat bias, reduce fear of fat
- Thunder Force is just one small step toward further visibility for positive representation of fat characters in film
