# The Cooler Superpower of Emily Stanton: Subverting the Invisibility of Fat Women in Film through Ben Falcone’s _Thunder Force_

## Abstract:

Anti-fat stigma demands that fat women become invisible. In film, they are often limited to roles reinforcing stereotypes,  depicted as either an apologetic failing or an insatiable appetite. However, Ben Falcone’s _Thunder Force_ includes two fat female leads playing superheroes, one with the power of invisibility. Emily Stanton uses her superpower to subvert the oppressive expectations of fat women, with regard to both race and gender. This paper critically analyzes _Thunder Force_ through a cultural and historical lens of fatness, examining how fat women are portrayed in film, and how they are made visible and invisible through that representation.
