The Tragedy Girls are 2 high school seniors, best friends McKayla Hooper and Sadie Cunningham (both named for horror movie influencers) and their obsessive desire to become famous via their true crime blog, twitter feed, and youtube channel. They decide to move on from simply reporting the news to make it themselves. They trap the local serial killer in an attempt to work with him planning murders so they can get an exclusive scoop. He refuses, and they realize they can DIY it and then just have him take the blame.
