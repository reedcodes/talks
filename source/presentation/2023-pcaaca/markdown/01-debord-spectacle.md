{% notes %}
In Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord offers a view of society that is no longer authentic and has been replaced by a preoccupation with appearance and representation. Society and culture consists of a _partial reality_ that divides everyday life because images are "mere representations" detached from lived experiences and from each other.
