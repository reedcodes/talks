Hey, what's up, friends? It's ya boi, Reed, comin' atcha from San Antonio at this year's PCA conference. Today we're gonna talk about -- Tragedy Girls! It's the story of 2 teen girls dreaming of social media fame and realizing it through any means necessary, including... murder. So buckle up, we've got a lot to cover, as we analyze Tyler MacIntyre's film as an example of how the horror genre critiques social media through the lens of Debord's Spectacle.

But before we get started on the film, we need to go over some concepts: first, what exactly _is_ the Spectacle? How do celebrity, social media, and horror film each relate to the Spectacle and each other? and why is the _Tragedy Girls_ story so perfect for discussing all this?

Content notes for screenshots of horror-movie blood and guts; sexual and violent language; spoilers for the film.

OK with all that -- let's go.
