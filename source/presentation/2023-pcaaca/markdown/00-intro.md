Hey, what's up, PCA? It's ya boi, Reed, comin' atcha from San Antonio at this year's conference. Today's episode is all about Tragedy Girls, Tyler McIntyre's 2017 film about 2 teen girls dreaming of social media fame and realizing it through any murderous means necessary. We're not just gonna talk about the movie; we're gonna get into Guy Debord's theory of the Spectacle, in particular his notions of images and celebrity. But to do that, we also gotta cover social media trends and the history of horror films, both through the lens of the Spectacle.

First some content notes, there are gifs galore, some graphicly gory screenshots from the film, and some sexual and/or violent language. Oh and spoilers for the movie.

With that in mind, grab your popcorn and buckle up for a wild ride through horror movie tropes in the age of social media. Let's get started.
