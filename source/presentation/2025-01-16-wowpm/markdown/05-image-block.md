## Image blocks in WordPress

Let's visit a very fake university website used as a sample WordPress site and check out what we can accomplish with core image blocks.

{% notes %}
Open sample wordpress website:

HOME PAGE: show with and without images.
1. Review hero image -- cover block. Purely decorative. No alt text.
1. Promo banners -- image block accompanied by text, that is not related to the image. Complements, does not inform. Purely decorative. No alt text.
1. Same with the Programs cards.
1. Photo gallery -- designed to showcase aspects of university life. These require alt text with effective descriptions.
1. Map/visit promo banner -- functional! The text accompanying the image provides contact info for the university. The image (describe it!) is a link to google maps to get directions to campus, so the alt text for the image is the function of the link.

ABOUT US: show with and without images.
1. Hero image -- cover block. Same as before.
1. Promo banner includes a photo of the university president along with text providing a message from the president. The image and the text are directly related, the photo is a professional profile, so the alt text of the image is the name of the university president.

SINGLE NEWS ARTICLE: show with and without images.
1. Featured image -- directly related to the news article, and needs alt text.
1. In-post image -- also directly related. This one has a caption. The image alt text describes what is _in_ the image while the caption describes what the image _represents_.

WP MEDIA LIBRARY:
1. View details for the path to campus
1. Show where to write the alt text, under the assumption that the image will be informational. This sets a default for whenever the image is inserted on a page.
1. View homepage: cover image -- Edit page, no alt text
1. View "spelling" news article: informational image with caption -- Edit page, alt text default.
