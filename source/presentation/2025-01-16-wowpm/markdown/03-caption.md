## Image captions

Captions are short pieces of text than can accompany images, and are typically displayed on the screen.

{% notes %}
Remember to read what's on screen!

While alt text might state what is visibly in an image, the caption usually describes a note about the image or the concept of it. Many times, if an image has a caption then it is probably not decorative and will need alt text. However, the alt text and the caption should not be redundant! The alt text is the literal description and the caption is _about_ the image.

Remember to read what's on screen!

If this image were included on a page about various types of flowers, then the purpose of this image is informational, and describing the details of what is included in the photo is more effective.
