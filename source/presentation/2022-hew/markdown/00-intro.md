Style guide? <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Pattern library? <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

{% notes %}
Old WP themes: Too many components! What is used where!? Code goto bloated, conflicting styles, etc. Further troubles with "static" gutenberg blocks

style guide: "source of truth"
- one place where everything is listed
- can tell which components are used inn ither components

pattern library: a more sustainable way of coding that truth
- change made to one component only made in one place for all instances
