## What we won't go over:

- CSS or Sass frameworks
- OOCSS, BEM, SMACSS, or Atomic
- creating Gutenberg blocks
- setting up WordPress themes

Notes:
- we'll go over how to define certain attributes in the CSS files, but no one method is preferred over another
- we'll go over how to include the Twig patterns in the custom blocks and themes, but not the particulars of setting them up
