- he receives a disturbing phone call <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- he finds a dead sex worker <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- he runs from the bad guys  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Is he the killer?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
When we first meet John Murdoch, our displaced hero, he wakes up, naked and disoriented, in a derelict hotel bathroom with no memory or who he is or how he got there.
- again, typical of noir, becomes the innocent on the run...

- Deckard: human or replicant? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Murdoch: identity and memory? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
compare to BR...
- Deckard struggles with his status as human or replicant
- Murdoch must confront the instability of his own identity and memory

> These narrative twists display the fatalistic element of film noir, where Deckard and Murdoch must struggle to regain control over their circumstances. Until they sort out the schemes they are each inadvertently part of, neither Deckard nor Murdoch fully understands what he is caught up in or the potential consequences that lie in wait. Only when they understand these things can they take action to extricate themselves. At the same time, both Deckard and Murdoch must discover who they are.
