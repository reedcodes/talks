- he finds a dead sex worker <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- he runs from the bad guys  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Is he the killer?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Deckard: human or replicant? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Murdoch: identity and memory? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
