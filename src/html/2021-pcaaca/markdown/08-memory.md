The Strangers theorize that memory is intrinsic to humanity and human identity, and if they manipulate humans’ memories, they can, as a result, uncover the secrets of humanity, and possibly salvation for their dying race.

Notes:
- memory manipulation = hallmark of dystopian fiction
- deliberate acts of memory signify resistance
- negotiate sense of self through acts of resistance against oppression and power
- first acts of resistance: failed memory imprint - even before he is fully aware of his trauma
- from his first blurry images of Shell Beach that trigger a flashback to a childhood he never actually lived, he actively pursues his lost memories

Notes:
- Science fiction narratives often adopt the language of computer information data when discussing human memory...
- Individuals who have been through a trauma may bury and repress the painful memories as a method of survival at the time, but later the memories may again surface and overwhelm them, making it difficult to process or integrate
- Memory is imperfect and agile, but when one expects it to be perfect and consistent, further trauma can occur
- Walenski exhibits this behavior when Bumstead visits him...

repetition compulsion <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text fragment" -->

Notes:
- Walenski’s confusion leads him to compulsively draw circles and spirals, first on all his case files, then on the walls of rooms in the apartment he shares with his wife
- Circles, spirals, and clocks are repeating motifs throughout the film
- measure the circular passage of time in a city of constant night
- symbolize repetition compulsion, or the unconscious tendency to repeat bad habits, unhealthy behaviors, or trauma responses
- When an individual with unprocessed trauma does not address their repressed memories or the cause of their emotional distress, it can lead to the overwhelming memories mentioned above and to further repetition compulsion

Notes:
Given the technology and the luxury, some would take advantage of a medicine or a machine to erase agonizing memory.
- In Edward Bellamy’s 1880 novel Dr. Heidenhoff’s Process, the titular doctor invents a procedure to extract memories from patients who wanted to remove certain painful episodes.
- Similarly, in Michel Gondry’s film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the memory extraction firm Lacuna, Inc., removes patients’ memories of past partners and preserves the records to tape.
- Unfortunately for Henry, the main character of Dr. Heidenhoff’s Process, the procedure was simply a dream, and he awakes to news of his fiancée’s suicide.
- In contrast, Joel and Clementine, the lovers in Eternal Sunshine, learn that they were once in a romantic relationship; at first horrified, they decide to confront their repressed memories, go into the relationship again with new knowledge, and break the cycle of repetition compulsion.

Notes:
Films like Eternal Sunshine and Dark City remind us that people can have the same experiences or visit the same places and still never have the same memories of those things, as they will come away from those things with different thoughts, feelings, or significance attached to the memories
