Notes:
- seek help, set boundaries, otherwise assert themselves find emotionally attacked
- based on the play Gas Light
- the emotional manipulation of another person into believing that their understanding of reality is unstable, that is intentional or unintentional, and that occurs over an extended period of time

Three stages to gaslighting:

1. disbelief at what the gaslighter is saying or trying to say <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. defense of self and self-truth as it conflicts with the gaslighter’s statements <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. depression and self-doubt as the gaslighter’s reality takes over <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- 3 stages...
- Knight and Knight: If you can’t remember who you know or what you value, how will you be able to decide what to do? Not to mention, if you don’t remember who you are, how will you be able to make any practical decisions except as contingent responses to circumstances you don’t fully understand? (29)

There is no escape. The city is ours. We made it... We fashioned this city on stolen memories, different eras, different pasts, all rolled into one. Each night we revise it, refine it, in order to learn [...] about you, Mr. Murdoch... what makes you human.

Notes:
Murdoch and the others have been manipulated by The Strangers many times with numerous implanted memories, their identities and their stories all based on lies fabricated by The Strangers and formulated by Dr. Schreber. They may wholeheartedly believe they are telling the truth, when it is only the story that has been fed to them (Fitch 21)...

- identify and understand that gaslighting is occurring
- difficult to accurately assess when it is happening

Notes:
For a victim of gaslighting to disentangle themself from the abusive situation, they need to...

During their journey down the canal on the way to Shell Beach, Dr. Schreber explains to Murdoch and Detective Bumstead the origins of The Strangers abuse, how they stole the humans for their experiments, but that none of the humans remembers where they originated anymore

- Abusers directly inform their victims of their “instability” rather than engage in any genuine, open conversation
- There is no way to argue with the abuser’s logic of a definitive statement or direction

Notes:
- initially not recognize the abuse
- Walenski: "sometimes, one of us wakes up"
- mirroring the Strangers' commands to "sleep" when they deem humans obtinate
- Emma's empty apartment, "new pretty things", call her Anna
- Emma is not Anna, Strangers say will be soon
- By the end of the film, Emma is gone, and Anna takes her place.
