emotional <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Notes:
Dark City argues that it is the emotional memory that prevails. As Murdoch sits in jail, he admits to Emma that they probably only met for the first time the previous night, yet she counters that she clearly recalls memories of meeting and falling in love with him. “I love you, John. You can’t fake something like that”

Notes:
- replicants in Blade Runner, who declare their photographs as evidence of their authentic memory
- In “Be Right Back”, for example, Ash and Martha move back into Ash’s childhood home, and he finds a photograph of himself as a boy, taken on an especially bad day. Martha calls it “sweet”, and Ash protests,
- ASH. Trust me, that day wasn’t sweet... [My mum’s] only boy giving her a fake smile.
- MARTHA. She didn’t know it was fake.
- ASH. Maybe that makes it worse.

Notes:
- printed document is not always true
- The city is full of physical items as evidence to history, to locations, and to each person’s backstory: photographs, postcards, and posters, but also scrapbooks, wedding rings, and even family accordions
- Uncle Karl’s house was supplied with a fully furnished childhood bedroom for “Johnny” and countless family photographs taken at Shell Beach
- Murdoch is fascinated until the slideshows stops on a photograph depicting a scar on his arm, supposedly caused by a fire that killed his parents — Murdoch has no such scar
