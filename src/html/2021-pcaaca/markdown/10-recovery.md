It is not strictly memory that informs a person’s perceived identity, but also what they do with that knowledge and how they form their own personal values and ethics.

Notes:
Murdoch once thought his memories were what defined his life and his identity, but has come to admit that he does not know which are real and which are implanted; he understands that he must work for the future regardless of the authenticity of his memories.

Recovery from trauma, emotional abuse, and gaslighting:

- actively resists repressing memories <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- works through the experience <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- processes their self-doubt <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- understands their true identity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- memories may or may not be remembered
- To mitigate the risk of becoming overwhelmed, the individual must allow themself to be vulnerable and form trust relationships with others

You will survive, John.

Notes:
- When Murdoch first confronts Dr. Schreber, and demands to know the truth about himself and the city, his Tuning abilities unleash uncontrollably as he reacts out of anger and fear
- Later, The Strangers order Schreber to imprint Murdoch with their collective memory, yet despite their instructions, he imprints Murdoch with his intended memories and “a lifetime of knowledge in a single syringe”
- By now, Murdoch has overcome much adversity, and through it, Schreber, initially questionable, proves himself loyal to Murdoch
- just before final confrontation...

Notes:
As Mr. Book hurls daggers at Murdoch, he applies his newly sharpened Tuning skills to defend himself, literally using the power of his mind to forge a protective barrier around himself. In this confrontation, Murdoch accepts that his memories have been fabricated and implanted by The Strangers and recognizes that his initial beliefs about himself are not accurate; he creates a new understanding of his identity and relies on his sense of self, not on what he has been told or what has been imprinted upon him.

Notes:
- Murdoch knows the truth
- rest of the inhabitants are still unaware of the reality of the city’s origins
- Murdoch is the one who will wake them up

Even with unreliable memories, Murdoch

- assesses his personal values <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- sets goals that align with those values <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- finds out how to achieve his goals <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- evaluates the best course of action <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- proceeds along that course to accomplish his goals <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- Shell Beach has been an inspiration to Murdoch and to all the inhabitants of the previously dark city, promising them a bright future full of personal agency and individuality, and its creation is his primary task following the defeat of The Strangers.
- As he prepares to open the door that will, at long last, reveal Shell Beach, Mr. Hand once more approaches Murdoch and pleads with him. “Are we sure that’s what we want?” Murdoch confidently replies, “I’m prepared to take my chances”.
- He may have doubt that he is making the right decisions, but he finally has the individual agency to make those decisions himself.
- Part of this process includes the choice to meet Anna on the pier.

Notes:
He demonstrates his vulnerability to her by inquiring as to the location of Shell Beach and by introducing himself. He could have taken advantage of his Tuning powers by producing new memories for Anna, or by replacing existing memories for Emma, but he instead resolves to being open to free will and taking risks, to putting the beginnings of healing into motion, and to ending the pattern of abuse.

> For me, Dark City is, I think, a film of hope and optimism. I mean, it’s... It has a firm belief in the individual winning out over the mass mind, and I think that’s a very important feeling to have in this world.
