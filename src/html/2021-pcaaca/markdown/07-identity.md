Notes:
- The Strangers have manipulated his memory, and Murdoch is unsure of his own sense of self
- As Dr. Schreber suggests to Emma, “wherever your husband is, he is searching for himself”

Notes:
- It is then only fitting that John’s name is Murdoch, an Anglicized form of the Gaelic name Murchadh, meaning “sea warrior” or “sea battler”

sea warrior <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Notes:
- Water is the "source of life"
- begins in the water of the bath, ends at Shell Beach
- When he awakens, Murdoch emerges from the bathtub as if from the womb, symbolizing his rebirth
- Ebert recounts student theory: first name John, book of the bible, hotel room number 614 as from the book
- “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world!”

Notes:
This scene also manifests Murdoch’s first miracle, using his newfound yet still undisciplined Tuning abilities: shot from above, we see Murdoch in a tub full of cloudy white water; later, shot from below, we watch as Murdoch slowly and carefully places the goldfish into a tub full of crystal clear water

Notes:
From the first moment Murdoch finds the postcard in the suitcase, he is on a quest to discover the location and the significance of Shell Beach. To him, Shell Beach is associated with his childhood; if he can get there, he can solve the puzzle of his missing identity.

**video of murdoch goes here**

Notes:
Upon leaving the hotel, the only “facts” he knows are the existence of Shell Beach from the postcard, and the part of his name — J. Murdoch — that was written in the guest register; Murdoch spends several minutes introducing himself to himself through the store windows, trying on different names to feel if any of them are right. His name, and everything about him, has been forced onto him by The Strangers, whose intentions for the city’s inhabitants supersede Murdoch’s individuality, similar to how emotionally abusive parents’ standards and expectations explicitly or implicitly communicate to their children that their own agency and self-worth is contingent on how well they adhere to those standards and expectations.

> <small class="citation"><cite>Dark City</cite> 1:11:15</small>

Notes:
- seeking answers to the same questions as the Strangers...
- continues journey like the flâneur
- observing the city and indirectly interacting with it
- dead body in the hotel implies, but he distrusts memories and evidence
- meets May, goes home with her
- “How do you know I’m not the killer?”
- “you don’t seem like the killer type”
- uncomfortable, Murdoch flees, drawn to a Shell Beach billboard
- no refuge, instead the Strangers gaslight him
- “it seems you’ve discovered your unpleasant nature”

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/screen-emma-john-apt.png" class="right" -->

Notes:
Murdoch, not yet aware of his Tuning abilities, reacts defensively and barely escapes, retreating to the apartment he shares with Emma and a home he hopes is safe. He relates his circumstances to Emma, disclosing his fears and anxieties about his uncertain identity:

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/screen-walenski.png" class="right" -->

Note:
- Walenski second to believe
- Murdoch happens upon the former detective in a subway station as he explores the transportation system, navigating various options for the correct route to Shell Beach. By this point, the trauma and gaslighting has greatly contributed to Walenski’s depression and suicidal ideation; even so, he recognizes Murdoch’s potential to extricate himself from the abuse, and provides him with encouragement, stating...
- “You’re not a killer. They set you up with a fake identity... No one knows who they are anymore”

Four aspects of identity:

1. a person’s sense of self is a response to their communication and interaction with others <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. identity characteristics are repeatedly and consistently expressed and presented to cement one’s sense of self <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. this sense of self is also agile, and open to change by absorbing new information or engaging in new interactions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. one’s desire to be accepted as part of society drives their commitment to adopt this sense of self <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
- 4 aspects based on Rob Cover's and Judith Butler's works
- because the Strangers constantly revise it, inhabitants do not have the opportunity to strengthen such bonds with their community
- cannot establish a clear sense of self
- This is, ironically, in direct contradiction to the goals of The Strangers’ experiments
