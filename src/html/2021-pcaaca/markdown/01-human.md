Notes:
several SF films have woven into their narrative
1. BRB - Martha gets a synthetic Ash and wrestles with her feelings
1. Dolls have memories wiped, Ballard tries to get authorities to see them as "people"
1. Caleb's boss Nathan asks him to perform a Turning test on Ava
1. replicants cling to the beliefs of their false pasts, right to free existence

![Dark City](images/eg-dark-city.jpg)

</div>

Notes:
Both Forgotten & DC examine humanity from an alien perspective. Delete memories, add new ones - learn more about "human identity". Take away human's agency
- treating them as objects instead of individuals
- manipulating their memories and leading them to think they are "going crazy"

Notes:
allegorical representations of
- trauma
- emotional abuse
